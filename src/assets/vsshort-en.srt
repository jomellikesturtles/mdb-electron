1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,736
where are you going so early?

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,494
Don't record any more messages
on my alarm clock.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,252
why not?

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,888
I'll start to think we're married
or something.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,732
Don't ever say that word.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,132
I'll never bring you chicken soup
and fuck your brains out again.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,774
- How's your cold?
- Still there. How about yours?

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,649
- You definitely took my mind off it.
- Really?

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,690
Yes!

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,376
Juliana here.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,010
Hi, Rayna. I missed my audition,
I lost my head!

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,977
Listen, I have to go.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,017
I'm with David.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,939
Help yourself to whatever you want.
Set the alarm before you go. And...

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,738
You are the greatest.

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,579
- Bye, honey!
- Bye, honey. I'll call you later.

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,968
when?

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,255
- When?
- Soon!
